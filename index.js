/*
A regular "function declaration", starts with the word function typed,
followed by the name of the function. So, we have to give a name to the function
Then, we place the paranthesis by the name, and then put in the curly braces.

within the curly braces, is where we have the function.

then, we call the function, by simply, typing the name of the function, and putting a paranthesis directly beside it.

So let's see this in action.
